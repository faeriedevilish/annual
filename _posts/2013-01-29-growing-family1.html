          <h4>LATIN AMERICA</h4>
          <h3>ESCUELA DE DATOS</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
            <p>2014 was an exciting year for <a href="http://escueladedatos.org">Escuela de Datos</a>: 3 big events (AbreLatam in Mexico, the Data Journalism Sessions in Spain, and the OGP meeting in Costa Rica); over 30 data trainings all over Latin America, and several events to keep this community growing in size and strength.</p>

            <p>This year also saw the addition of two fellows to the Escuela de Datos family: Antonio Cucho, the young man behind the Open Data community in Peru (and who is heavily involved in Ojo Público, a promising data journalism project); and Rubén Moya, a Mexican computer scientist that found his calling as a data trainer, and in helping organizations seize the power of data.</p>

          <p>This year, the <a href="http://okfn.es/">group in Spain</a> organised activities primarily in Madrid and Barcelona this year; most of the activity is offline, but e-learning workshops are being planned, too. They held monthly sessions at <a href="http://medialab-prado.es/article/periodismo_de_datos_-_grupo_de_trabajo">Medialab-Prado Madrid</a> and <a href="http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/category/proj/periodismo-datos/">CCCB Barcelona</a> made up with free workshops, with all of the talks streamed and/or recorded.</p>

          <p>This year, they also held the three day long <a href="http://periodismodatos.okfn.es/">Annual Conference on Data Journalism and Open Data</a>, attended by almost five hundred people- the conference was full of talks, workshops, barcamps and hackathons, too! The group's main goals for 2015 are to keep sharing ddj knowledge in through offline events like datafests, hackathons, barecamps, dataexpeditions and workshops in more cities, to launch an online presence, and to prepare their first MOOC.</p>

 			<p>Our group in France have localised a version of the School of Data site, with translation into French and set up of the <a href="http://ecoledesdonnees.org/handbook/cours/">Ecole des Données site</a> together with translation of some of the basic online courses into French. This year, they also held a public data expedition on the subject of Air pollution in Paris urban area, and we were very happy to see members of the group at our Summer Camp in 2014.</p>

          <p>At the end of 2013, the group in Greece teamed up with the Media Informatics Lab of School of Journalism & Mass Communication, and the Master of Web Science of School of Mathematics of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, to translate <a href="http://datajournalism.okfn.gr/">the Data Journalism Handbook into Greek</a>, and this year, the book began to be used in the undergraduate curriculum of Journalism & Mass Media Department at the University of Thessaloniki. Through this, they created <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2014/05/26/greek-data-expedition-and-data-journalism/">articles based on data</a> and some great infographics - to learn more, check out <a href="http://schoolofdata.okfn.gr/blog/">their blog</a>.</p>
