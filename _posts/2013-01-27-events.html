          On June 15th, the French Open Knowledge local groupe organised a public data expedition on the subject of AIr pollution in Paris urban area. Attendees were divided in 3 groups and worked on the following topics: The impact of transit strikes on air pollution / Does the increasing use of bikes reduce the city's air pollution ? / How do major cities fare against air pollution ? The theme was admittedly difficult, but the general feedback was positive..</p>
