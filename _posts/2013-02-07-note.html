        <p>There is huge potential to use data and open data to improve the lives of citizens around the world, especially in increasing the transparency and accountability of governments. However, many of the groups who are closest to the problems – NGOs, journalists, and citizens – currently lack the skills to use data effectively — and even an awareness of the potential of data for their work.</p>
        
        <p>School of Data has been working now for two years ago to address this need, successfully training civil society organisations and journalists, teaching them to use data to find evidence, create compelling visualisations and tell stories to present their arguments with more force. Our mission to empower the citizens and organisations who wish to use data ‘for good’ with the skills they need.</p>

        <p>2014 was a year of lots of ‘firsts’ for us. We started our flagship Fellowship scheme, which saw us working with 12 incredible data storytellers from around the world. We ran our very first summer camp, in Berlin. Dedicated community members launched localised nodes of School of Data in France, Spain and Greece. Our core team got smaller, but our range of activities got bigger, run by people who know their local contexts far better than we do.</p>
        
        <p>We can’t thank our wonderful, dedicated, passionate community enough; for guiding us when we needed it, for holding us to high standards, for showing us where and how School of Data is needed in their communities, and for having so much fun along the way! </p>
