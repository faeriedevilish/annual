      <h3>EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD</h3>
      <p>Online and offline events form a big part of School of Data; this year, because of the Fellowship scheme, we did a lot more offline events than we have in previous years, reaching a lot more new people! From the 70+ events that we can count from this year, there is an incredible diversity of topics covered, formats of events, audiences, and outcomes. We were so proud to watch the fellows pick up tips from the summer camp, then take them back and adapt them to their own contexts - and just look at what they achieved!

          On June 15th, the French Open Knowledge local groupe organised a public data expedition on the subject of AIr pollution in Paris urban area. Attendees were divided in 3 groups and worked on the following topics: The impact of transit strikes on air pollution / Does the increasing use of bikes reduce the city's air pollution ? / How do major cities fare against air pollution ? The theme was admittedly difficult, but the general feedback was positive..</p>
